CHANGELOG
=========

0.6 Collections Management
--------------------------

Release adding collections creation and management, as well as CSV exports of all digitized works.

CSV Export
^^^^^^^^^^
* As an admin, I want to generate a CSV report of materials on the site so that I can do analysis with other tools such as OpenRefine to analyze collection assignment.

Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^
* As an admin, I want to create and update collections so that I can group digitized works into subcollections for site users.
* As an admin, I want to add and edit collection descriptions so that I can help site users understand the collection and find related materials.
* As an admin, I want to add individual digitized items to one or more collections so that I can manage which items are included in which collections.
* As an admin, I want a way to search and select digitized items for bulk addition to a collection so that I can efficiently organize large groups of items.
* As a user, I want to browse the list of collections so I can find out more about important groupings of items in the archive.
*  As a user, I want to filter search results by collection so that I can include or exclude groups of materials based on my interests.




0.5 Bulk Import and Simple Search
---------------------------------

Initial release with basic admin functionality, import/index Hathi materials, and a basic search to allow interacting and testing the Solr index.

User Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* As a project team member, I want to login with my Princeton CAS account so that I can use existing credentials and not have to keep track of a separate username and password.
* As an admin, I want to edit user and group permissions so I can manage project team member access within the system.
* As an admin, I want an easy way to give project team members archive management and content editing permissions so that I donâ€™t have to keep track of all the individual required permissions.


HathiTrust Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* As an admin, I want a bulk import of HathiTrust materials so that previously identified and downloaded data can be added to the system.
* As an admin, I want to see a list of all digitized materials in the archive so that I can view and manage the contents.
* As an admin, I want to see when an item was added to the archive and when it was last modified so that I can see which materials were added and changed and when.
* As an admin, I want to see the history of all edits to a digitized work, including import and updates via script, so that I can track the full history of contributions and changes to the record.
* As a user, I want to search and browse digitized volumes by keyword so that I can see what materials are in the archive.
* As a user, I want to see basic details for individual items in the archive so that I can see the record details and get to the HathiTrust version.
