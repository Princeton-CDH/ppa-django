        <p>Welcome to the Princeton Prosody Archive, a full-text searchable database of thousands of digitized books published between 1570 and 1923.
            The Archive collects historical documents and highlights discourses about the study of language,
            the study of poetry, and where and how these intersect and diverge.</p>
        <p>The PPA began as a collection of texts about versification. Now it covers the study of poetry, grammar, literary history, and speech.
            We understand the PPA collections to be necessarily incomplete – a starting point for new scholarship in historical poetics and historical linguistics.
            As such, we intend the words “prosody” and “archive” in their broadest possible senses.</p>
        <p>The PPA makes several arguments, poses several questions, and welcomes new scholarship based on the work gathered here.
            Some of our initial questions include: What if we began to understand poetics in all of its
            historical, linguistic, and educational valences?</p>
        <p>What if literary concepts such as meter and rhythm are historically contingent and fundamentally unstable?
            What might scholars of distant reading the novel learn from a collection of materials pertaining to poetry?</p>
        <p>Rather than a static repository of historical data, the PPA would like to compel users to rethink the past
            and future of organizing, navigating, conceptualizing, and historicizing large amounts of data – about a single
            poem or about evolving and contradictory thinking about the technology of poetic language.</p>

                        study of versification and the study of pronunciation.
                        In literary studies, prosody is often interchanged
                        for versification or meter, though in fact each of
                        these terms have complicated and contested histories.

                        the Archive in 2007 as she was writing <i>The Rise and

                        1860 – 1930</i>. Brogan was the first to assemble
                        bibliographic records for 1,743 works on
                        versification and prosody.
