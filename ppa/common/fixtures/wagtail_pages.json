What I present here are several paths through the Princeton Prosody Archive, a database built in collaboration with the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton (which I started so that I could learn how to make something like the Princeton Prosody Archive) and with the support of the HathiTrust Library, who provided data and metadata to allow me to curate a collection of materials pertaining to the study of poetry and language from the 16th century to 1923. The original bibliographic source for the materials in the Prosody Archive is T.V.F. Brogan\\u2019s analog (though available online) <i>Guide to English Versification 1540-1985</i>, which contains several sub-sections and subcategories of material found mostly in the British Library and Library Congress, as well as everything the HathiTrust Library under the Library of Congress headings you see here. As many of you know, over the course of the past several years I\\u2019ve been working to locate every record from Brogan\\u2019s bibliography (at this stage I have about 4/5ths of them) in full-text searchable form, supplemented by my own additional bibliography.
