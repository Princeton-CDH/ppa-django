Now it covers the study of poetry, grammar, literary history, and speech. We understand the PPA collections to be necessarily incomplete – a starting point for new scholarship in historical poetics and historical linguistics. As such, we intend the words “prosody” and “archive” in their broadest possible senses.</p><p>The PPA makes several arguments, poses several questions, and welcomes new scholarship based on the work gathered here. Some of our initial questions include: What if we began to understand poetics in all of its historical, linguistic, and educational valences?</p><p>What if literary concepts such as meter and rhythm are historically contingent and fundamentally unstable? What might scholars of distant reading the novel learn from a collection of materials pertaining to poetry?</p><p>Rather than a static repository of historical data, the PPA would like to compel users to rethink the past and future of organizing, navigating, conceptualizing, and historicizing large amounts of data – about a single poem or about evolving and contradictory thinking about the technology of poetic language.</p>",

Her research would not have been possible without the pioneering work of T.V. F. Brogan, whose 1981 bibliography <i>English Versification, 1570–1980: A Reference Guide With a Global Appendix</i> is the original source for this project. T.V.F. Brogan passed away in 2012, and the Princeton Prosody Archive is dedicated to his memory.</p><p>What began as three ring binders in 2007 turned into an unruly Endnote file in 2008, and in 2009, was transformed into two rounds of linked articles in an early version of Zotero. A frozen Firefox browser stalled one MacBook and three hard-drives, and finally, after receiving a grant from the Princeton Council on the Humanities in 2010, Martin hired a contracted programmer who unsuccessfully attempted to build full-text search functionality with page images in a MySQL database. It was increasingly clear that Princeton needed a Center for Digital Humanities to help consult Martin on the project.</p><p>Concurrent to starting the Digital Humanities Initiative at Princeton, Martin shifted her focus away from including journal articles in the Archive when Princeton University Counsel could not reach an agreement with publishing company Gale to allow for both full-text searching and page image displays for the periodical materials. With the help of project manager Grant Wythoff (2009-2013), the PPA partnered with Google Books and HathiTrust in 2011. The HathiTrust delivered more than 8,000 monographs – their full text and MARC metadata – for the PPA to host on its servers. In 2012, the PPA was awarded an Officer’s Grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to begin imagining a public version of the Archive. In 2013, the PPA hired Travis Brown, who was then working at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). Brown developed the back-end of PPA 2.0, which allowed users to browse and search through its fully indexed content. Ben Johnston was been the technical lead at Princeton in consultation with current project manager Meagan Wilson (who began her tenure in the fall of 2013). Since 2015, Wilson worked tirelessly to clean the collection of duplicate records and Martin worked tirelessly to create a Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton.</p>",

Now it covers the study of poetry, grammar, literary history, and speech. We understand the PPA collections to be necessarily incomplete – a starting point for new scholarship in historical poetics and historical linguistics. As such, we intend the words “prosody” and “archive” in their broadest possible senses.</p><p>The PPA makes several arguments, poses several questions, and welcomes new scholarship based on the work gathered here. Some of our initial questions include: What if we began to understand poetics in all of its historical, linguistic, and educational valences?</p><p>What if literary concepts such as meter and rhythm are historically contingent and fundamentally unstable? What might scholars of distant reading the novel learn from a collection of materials pertaining to poetry?</p><p>Rather than a static repository of historical data, the PPA would like to compel users to rethink the past and future of organizing, navigating, conceptualizing, and historicizing large amounts of data – about a single poem or about evolving and contradictory thinking about the technology of poetic language.</p>",

Brogan, whose 1981 bibliography <i>English Versification, 1570\\u20131980: A Reference Guide With a Global Appendix</i> is the original source for this project. T.V.F. Brogan passed away in 2012, and the Princeton Prosody Archive is dedicated to his memory.</p><p>What began as three ring binders in 2007 turned into an unruly Endnote file in 2008, and in 2009, was transformed into two rounds of linked articles in an early version of Zotero. A frozen Firefox browser stalled one MacBook and three hard-drives, and finally, after receiving a grant from the Princeton Council on the Humanities in 2010, Martin hired a contracted programmer who unsuccessfully attempted to build full-text search functionality with page images in a MySQL database. It was increasingly clear that Princeton needed a Center for Digital Humanities to help consult Martin on the project.</p><p>Concurrent to starting the Digital Humanities Initiative at Princeton, Martin shifted her focus away from including journal articles in the Archive when Princeton University Counsel could not reach an agreement with publishing company Gale to allow for both full-text searching and page image displays for the periodical materials. With the help of project manager Grant Wythoff (2009-2013), the PPA partnered with Google Books and HathiTrust in 2011. The HathiTrust delivered more than 8,000 monographs \\u2013 their full text and MARC metadata \\u2013 for the PPA to host on its servers. In 2012, the PPA was awarded an Officer\\u2019s Grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to begin imagining a public version of the Archive. In 2013, the PPA hired Travis Brown, who was then working at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). Brown developed the back-end of PPA 2.0, which allowed users to browse and search through its fully indexed content. Ben Johnston was been the technical lead at Princeton in consultation with current project manager Meagan Wilson (who began her tenure in the fall of 2013). Since 2015, Wilson worked tirelessly to clean the collection of duplicate records and Martin worked tirelessly to create a Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton.</p>\"}, {\"id\": \"ef7b7d18-1114-4f29-a3e3-c5f24b088de0\", \"type\": \"footnotes\", \"value\": \"<ul><li>citation</li></ul>\"}]"

What I present here are several paths through the Princeton Prosody Archive, a database built in collaboration with the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton (which I started so that I could learn how to make something like the Princeton Prosody Archive) and with the support of the HathiTrust Library, who provided data and metadata to allow me to curate a collection of materials pertaining to the study of poetry and language from the 16th century to 1923. The original bibliographic source for the materials in the Prosody Archive is T.V.F. Brogan\\u2019s analog (though available online) <i>Guide to English Versification 1540-1985</i>, which contains several sub-sections and subcategories of material found mostly in the British Library and Library Congress, as well as everything the HathiTrust Library under the Library of Congress headings you see here. As many of you know, over the course of the past several years I\\u2019ve been working to locate every record from Brogan\\u2019s bibliography (at this stage I have about 4/5ths of them) in full-text searchable form, supplemented by my own additional bibliography.
