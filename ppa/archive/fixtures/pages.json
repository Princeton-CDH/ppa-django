A frozen Firefox browser stalled one MacBook and three hard-drives, and finally, after receiving a grant from the Princeton Council on the Humanities in 2010, Martin hired a contracted programmer who unsuccessfully attempted to build full-text search functionality with page images in a MySQL database. It was increasingly clear that Princeton needed a Center for Digital Humanities to help consult Martin on the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"\">Concurrent to starting the Digital Humanities Initiative at Princeton, Martin shifted her focus away from including journal articles in the Archive when Princeton University Counsel could not reach an agreement with publishing company Gale to allow for both full-text searching and page image displays for the periodical materials. With the help of project manager Grant Wythoff (2009-2013), the PPA partnered with Google Books and HathiTrust in 2011. The HathiTrust delivered more than 8,000 monographs &ndash; their full text and MARC metadata &ndash; for the PPA to host on its servers. In 2012, the PPA was awarded an Officer&rsquo;s Grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to begin imagining a public version of the Archive. In 2013, the PPA hired Travis Brown, who was then working at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). Brown developed the back-end of PPA 2.0, which allowed users to browse and search through its fully indexed content. Ben Johnston was been the technical lead at Princeton in consultation with current project manager Meagan Wilson (who began her tenure in the fall of 2013). Since 2015, Wilson worked tirelessly to clean the collection of duplicate records and Martin worked tirelessly to create a Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton. <\/span><\/p>"
