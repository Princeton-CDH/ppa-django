Much of her research would not have been possible without the pioneering work of T.V. F. Brogan, whose 1981 bibliography <em>English Versification, 1570&ndash;1980: A Reference Guide With a Global Appendix <\/em>is the original source for this project. Brogan was the first to assemble bibliographic records for 1,743 works on versification and prosody. We have included 578 out-of-copyright books from this bibliography, and we are expanding the collection to include works from 1570 by gathering and scanning the remaining materials (most of which are periodical and newspaper articles). T.V.F. Brogan passed away in 2012, and the Princeton Prosody Archive is dedicated to his memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>What began as three ring binders in 2007 turned into an unruly Endnote file in 2008, and in 2009, was transformed into two rounds of linked articles in an early version of Zotero. A frozen Firefox browser stalled one MacBook and three hard-drives, and finally, after receiving a grant from the Princeton Council on the Humanities in 2010, Martin hired a contracted programmer who unsuccessfully attempted to build full-text search functionality with page images in a MySQL database. It was increasingly clear that Princeton needed a Center for Digital Humanities to help consult Martin on the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Concurrent to starting the Digital Humanities Initiative at Princeton, Martin shifted her focus away from including journal articles in the Archive when Princeton University Counsel could not reach an agreement with publishing company Gale to allow for both full-text searching and page image displays for the periodical materials. (Because prosodic materials are often not readable by regular OCR, page images are crucial). With the help of project manager Grant Wythoff (2009-2013), the PPA partnered with Google Books and HathiTrust in 2011. The HathiTrust delivered more than 8,000 monographs &ndash; their full text and MARC metadata &ndash; for the PPA to host on its servers. In 2012, the PPA was awarded an Officer&rsquo;s Grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to begin imagining a public version of the Archive. In 2013, the PPA hired Travis Brown, who was then working at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). Brown developed the back-end of the current PPA beta-site, which allows users to browse and search through its fully indexed content. Ben Johnston has been the technical lead at Princeton in consultation with current project manager Meagan Wilson (who began her tenure in the fall of 2013). The Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton completed its inaugural year in 2014-2015.<\/span><\/p>"

        "content": "<p><span style=\"\">Prosody today means both the study of versification and the study of pronunciation. In literary studies, prosody is often interchanged for versification or meter, though in fact each of these terms have complicated and contested histories. Historically, Prosody was a subsection of Grammar, appearing at the end of the traditional grammar book after Orthometry, Etymology, and Syntax. Within Prosody, Versification appeared after punctuation, utterance, and pronunciation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"\">The Oxford English Dictionary defines prosody as such: 1. The theory and practice of versification; (in technical use) the branch of knowledge which deals with the forms of metrical composition, and formerly also with the pronunciation of words, esp. as this relates to versification; (more generally) the patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry. As a count noun: a metrical form or scheme; &dagger;a treatise on metrical composition (obs.).Prosody was formerly regarded as a branch of grammar), and taken to include the study of phonology and phonetics.<\/span><\/p>"
