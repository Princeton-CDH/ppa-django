<HEAD>NOTES On <HI>MILTON</HI>'s PARADISE Lost.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PARADISE,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is a word of <HI>Persian</HI> Extraction, whence the <HI>Jews</HI> bor∣rowed it, and of them the <HI>Grecians:</HI> Though they who affect such Gingles, de∣rive <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to water round about; because it was a Place, according to the Description of <HI>Moses,</HI> watered by some of the most famous Ri∣vers of the World. This adopted <HI>Hebrew</HI> word is found but in three places in the Old Testament, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> 5. <HI>Nehem.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> 8. and <HI>Cantic.</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> 13. where it is styled a <HI>Paradise of Pomegranates;</HI> expressive every where of a Place of the greatest Perfection, Pleasure, Plenty and Delight imaginable. <HI>Xenophon</HI> tells us of divers <HI>Paradises,</HI> (like Fortu∣nate Islands) encompassed by <HI>Euphrates;</HI> and <HI>Phil. in Vit. Apoll.</HI> mentions Many, in which not only the choicest Trees and Fruits, the most sweet and beautiful Flowers, the most fragrant and lasting Greens, but Multitudes of living Creatures of the selectest sorts were enclosed; whence <HI>Aul. Gell. Est autem Paradisus, omnis locus amaenissimus, &amp; voluptatis ple∣nissimus, quem etiam vivaria dici à Latinis, l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 20. <HI>Noct. Alt.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Paradise</HI> was not Allegorical or Figurative, (according to <HI>Origen,</HI> St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> and others) is not only confirmed by the general Consent of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers; nor Fantastical, according to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Cabbala: But a part of <HI>Asia,</HI> where <HI>Babylon</HI> was af∣terwards built, and known by the Name of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> as lying between the <HI>Euphrates</HI> and the <HI>Tygris;</HI> both the Description of <HI>Moses,</HI> the Nature of the Soil, and the Compari∣son of many places of Scripture most evidently make out. Of the Fertility of the Coun∣try, <HI>Q. Curtius</HI> gives this Testimony, <HI>Resudat toto ferè solo humor, qui ex utroque amne (Eu∣phrate &amp; Tigri) manat per aquarum vends, &amp; solo Babylonico foelicitatem affert maximam.</HI></P>
<P>In this Garden of God, as it is called <HI>Gen.</HI> 13. 10. abounding with all things, the choicest and most excellent the Earth ever bore, God seated our great Progenitors, in a Condi∣tion so superlatively happy, that our blessed Saviour was pleased by it to Typifie the high and happy State of Everlasting Life, <HI>Luk.</HI> 23. 43. <HI>This day thou shalt be with me in Pa∣radise.</HI></P>
<P>The Forfeiture of this Innocent and Blissful Seat, by the Disobedience of our first Pa∣rents, and their deserved Expulsion out of this <HI>Paradise,</HI> is the sad Subject of this un∣parallell'd Poem.</P>
<P>V. 2. <HI>The Fruit of that Forbidden Tree.</HI> It imports not much to know, nor can it be de∣termined, what kind this Interdicted Tree was of, the Prohibition having no regard to, or influence on, its Fruit, more than that it was made the Trial of Man's entire Obedience to his Maker. <HI>Moses Barcepha</HI> endeavours to prove it a Fig-Tree, because the Offenders had its Leaves so ready at hand to cover their Nakedness, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 7. But this implies no more, than that a Tree of that kind, stood in its dangerous Neighborhood. It seemeth on the contrary, not reasonable to imagine, <HI>Adam</HI> should presume to cloath his Naked∣ness, the Consequence of his Offence, with the Leaves of the same Tree, the Eating of
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
whose Fruit had been the cause of his Offending; especially when according to <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 3. the Prohibition was so strict and severe, that it had been a Daring second to his shameful Sin, but to have touch'd that sacred Tree; sacred (as our Author tells us) to Abstinence, secluded and set apart from all Enjoyment.</P>
<P>The common Opinion, That this Tree so set apart, and secluded by God's Command, was an Apple-Tree, is weakly grounded on <HI>Cantic.</HI> 8. 5. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>&amp;c. sub arbore malo suscitavi te. Ibi corrupta est mater tua, ibi violata est genetrix tua,</HI> more expressive of the Original than our Translation, <HI>I raised thee up under an Apple-Tree, there thy Mother con∣ceived thee, there she conceived that bare thee:</HI> But this excellent Song is wholly Allegorical, and not to be literally understood.</P>
<P>V. 2. <HI>Whose mortal taste; Mortalis,</HI> Lat. deadly: The taste of this Forbidden Fruit is called Deadly, not as such in its own Nature, and therefore prohibited; but by the Pro∣hibition, being made the Test of Man's Obedience, became pernicious to him by violating his Creator's Command, and brought forth Death and Hell.</P>
<P>V. 4. <HI>With loss of EDEN;</HI> Of <HI>Paradise,</HI> which by God was planted Eastward in <HI>Eden,</HI> as to the place where <HI>Moses</HI> wrote, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 8. though <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signifies Pleasure and Delight, from whence perhaps the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and also <HI>Adonis horti,</HI> from some knowledge the Ancient Poets had of the Writings of <HI>Moses</HI> and this Garden of <HI>Eden.</HI> And although St. <HI>Hierom,</HI> and after him <HI>Cajetan</HI> and others, and in some places the LXX (though not in this) translate <HI>Eden,</HI> Pleasure, as <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 8. <HI>Plantaverat autem Dominus Deus Paradisum voluptatis,</HI> yet undoubtedly <HI>Eden</HI> is here the proper Name of a Region, as will be more evident from <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 16. <HI>Ezech.</HI> 27. 23. <HI>Isai.</HI> 37. 12.</P>
<P>Divers have been the Opinions of Men, and Many, even of the Learned, absurd enough, concerning the Site of this Terrestrial <HI>Paradise:</HI> Some have fancied it in the Moon, others beyond an Unnavigable Ocean, others under the Equinox; some, near the North-Pole; others, above the middle Region of the Air: But the Learned Sir <HI>Walt. Rawleigh</HI> plainly proves, God planted this Delightful Garden in <HI>Eden,</HI> (Eastward in respect of <HI>Judaea)</HI> which was afterwards called <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> where <HI>Tygris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates</HI> joyn their Streams, and taking several Courses water <HI>Chus</HI> and <HI>Havilah</HI> according to <HI>Moses,</HI> the Seat of <HI>Chus</HI> and his Sons being then in the Valley of <HI>Shinar,</HI> where <HI>Nimrod</HI> built <HI>Babel.</HI> A Climate of all others the most temperate, 35 Degrees from the Equinoxial, and 55 from the Pole; abounding with most Excellent Wines, Fruits, Oyl, and Grain of all sorts, where, as the most perfect proof of Fertility, Palm-Trees grow in great numbers at this Day, without Care or Cultivation.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>One greater Man,</HI> the Man Christ Jesus, much greater than the Protoplast <HI>Adam,</HI> as being both God and Man, the perfect Image of his Father, who fulfill'd all Righteous∣ness, and was made a Propitiation for us.</P>
<P>V. 6. <HI>Sing, Heav'nly Muse:</HI> Inform me, Heavenly Muse, who didst instruct the Shep∣herd <HI>Moses,</HI> who first taught the Sons of <HI>Israel,</HI> how the Heavens and Earth were made, and how this Beauteous Universe arose in such bright various Forms out of Confusion.</P>
<P>The Poets, Ancient and Modern, in the beginning of their most Considerable Works at least, call some one, or all, the Muses to their Assistance:
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Musa, mihi causas memora a AEn.</HI> 1. <HI>Nunc age qui Reges Erato, &amp;c. Tu vatem, tu, diva, mone, AEn.</HI> 7. <HI>Pandite nunc Helicona, deae, cantusque movete, AEn.</HI> 10.</P>
<P>So one of our own:
<Q><L><HI>Begin then, O my dearest, sacred Dame,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Daughter of</HI> Phoebus <HI>and of Memory,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That dost Ennoble, with Immortal Name,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Warlike Worthies of Antiquity,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In thy great Volume of Eternity.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Begin,</HI> O Clio, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Spen. B. 3. C. 3.</L></Q></P>
<P>As our Author has attempted agreater Undertaking than that of either of those two Master-Poets, so he had need to Invoke this Heavenly Muse, whom a little after he explains by God's Holy Spirit, to inspire and assist him: And well he might, being to sing, not only of the Beauteous Universe, and all Created Beings, but of the Creator Himself, and all those Revelations and Dispensations He had been pleased to make to Faln Man through the Great Redeemer of the World, His Son. This Argument might need a Divine In∣structress, preferable to any of their Invoked Assistants, though styled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Daughters of <HI>Jove.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
The Christian Poet, the famous <HI>Torquato Tasso,</HI> the Darling of discerning <HI>Italy,</HI> begins his <HI>Exordium,</HI>
<Q><L>O Musa, tu che di caduchi allori,</L>
<L>Non circondi la fronte in Helicona</L>
<L>Ma sù nel Cielo infra i beati Chori,</L>
<L>Hai di stelle immortali aurea Corona,</L>
<L>Tu spira al petto mio Celesti ardore, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>These are the choicest Lines that adorn his Invocation; in which, though he calls to his Assistance the same Heavenly Spirit, yet we shall find him fall short of our Poet, both as to the Sublimity of his Thoughts and Argument, as much as <HI>Helicon</HI> is inferiour to <HI>Horeb,</HI> and that he had but too just occasion to ask Pardon (as he does in the end of this <HI>Stanza)</HI> for mixing and intangling Truth with vain Fiction.</P>
<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> Muse, Lat. <HI>Musa,</HI> from Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>ab inquisitione.</HI></P>
<P>V. 7. <HI>Oreb, or of Sinai.</HI> The Poets use to mention their <HI>Parnassus,</HI> the Famous Haunt of the Muses; ours opposes to it his <HI>Oreb, Nam neque Parnassi vobis juga, nam neque Pindi Vlla moram fecere,</HI> Virg. Ecl. 10. <HI>Horeb</HI> and <HI>Sinai</HI> are not two distinct Mountains, but One variously so called, as <HI>Deut.</HI> 5. 2. <HI>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Oreb;</HI> and <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. 2, 3, 4. <HI>c.&amp;</HI> the same Place, in which the Law (God's Covenant with the <HI>Jews)</HI> was given and promulged, is named <HI>Sinai.</HI> It is a Mountain of <HI>Arabia Petraea,</HI> parted at the top into two Hills, of which <HI>Sinai</HI> is much the highest. The <HI>Jews</HI> tell us, this later Appellation was given the Mountain, in Memory of the Bush in which God ap∣peared to <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 3. 2. who calls Himself <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Inhabitant is rubum, Deut.</HI> 33. 16. And the <HI>Rabbins</HI> confidently assure us, the very Fragments of Stones gathered on this Mountain, shew the Image of that Incombustible Bush, whence it was named <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> before that called only <HI>Horeb.</HI></P>
<P>Its Top or Summity is said to be secret, either as hid among the Clouds, or rather from that thick Darkness which cover'd the Mount, when God spake there with his Ser∣vant <HI>Moses,</HI> as in private, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. 16. In Memory of which, it is by the <HI>Arabians</HI> named at this Day <HI>Gibel-Mousa,</HI> the Mountain of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>V. 8. <HI>That Shepherd, Moses, Exod.</HI> 3. 1. though he was also in <HI>Homer</HI>'s sense <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, God having led his People through the Wilderness by the Hands of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron.</HI></P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Who first taught,</HI> That the Mosaical Philosophy is most Ancient, is not only very certain, but that all the Heathen Poets, and their greatest Philosophers too, borrowed their Description of the <HI>Chaos,</HI> and what they delivered of the first Formation of Matter from the Creation, as delineated by <HI>Moses,</HI> whose Writings many of them saw, though they did not understand them. Hence <HI>Mercur. Trismegist.</HI> in his <HI>Pimand.</HI> 3. gives us this Relation; <HI>Erant Tenebrae infinitae in Abysso &amp; Aqua, &amp; Spiritus tenuis intelligibilis, quae di∣vinâ virtute er ant in ipso Chao.</HI> And <HI>Plato</HI> in <HI>Timaeo,</HI> discoursing of the Fabrication of the World; <HI>Quicquid erat non tranquillum &amp; quietum, sed immoderatè agitatum &amp; quasi fluctu∣ans, id assumpsit, &amp; ex inordinato ad ordinem adduxit, &amp;c.</HI> These, and many such, are the obscure Comments on the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Moses, Gen.</HI> 1. 2. signifying Desolation and Emptiness, though we read it <HI>without form and void,</HI> and the LXX translate it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, invisible.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>The chosen Seed,</HI> the <HI>Israelites,</HI> the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> God's chosen People, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. 5.</P>
<P>V. 10. <HI>Rose out of Chaos. Chaos</HI> is a wide, dark, gaping Gulph, a vast unfathomable Deep, by which the Poets express the Confusion of uninformed Matter, out of which, at the Creator's Word, this Wonderful World arose.
<Q><L><HI>Unus erat toto Naturae vultus in Orbe</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quem dixere Chaos, rudis indigestaque Moles.</HI> Meta. Li. 1.</L>
<L><HI>Et Chaos innumeros avidum confundere Mundos.</HI> Luc. Li. 6.</L>
<L><HI>Antiquum repetent iterum Chaos omnia, &amp;c.</HI> Luc. Li. 1.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Chaos</HI> is, by <HI>Hesiod</HI> in his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, made the Ancestor of the Gods, whose Progenitors he names <HI>Chaos,</HI> the <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Love;</HI> thereby intimating the Beginning of all things, as <HI>Virg.</HI> uses the word, <HI>áque Chao densos divum numerabat amores.</HI> Geo. Li. 4.</P>
<P>This Original <HI>Chaos</HI> is by some fancied from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to gape; by <HI>Philo demundo</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as being a Mixture of fluid Matter. <HI>Eugub.</HI> in his <HI>Cosmopoeiâ,</HI> take notices of the small difference between <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (the word the <HI>Greek</HI> Philosophers express the Worlds first Matter by) and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Mud and Slime, where all things lay wrapt and swallowed up in the Womb of Water.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Ibid. <HI>Sion-Hill,</HI> a Mountain in <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> On this Hill stood the Strong-hold of the <HI>Jebusites,</HI> which King <HI>David</HI> took, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5. 7. and made it the place of his Residence, and named it <HI>The City of David;</HI> which, when <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was in its greatest Glory, was called the Upper City.</P>
<P>V. 11. <HI>Siloa</HI> was a small Brook, as appears by <HI>Isai.</HI> 8. 6. arising on the East-side of the Temple in <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> of which, the Tower our Saviour mentions <HI>Luc.</HI> 13. 4. probably took its Name.</P>
<P>V. 12. <HI>Fast by the Oracle of God,</HI> close by God's Temple, (as before) where he gave his Sacred Oracles; <HI>Oracula,</HI> Lat.</P>
<P>V. 13. <HI>Invoke,</HI> pray, call upon, from <HI>invocare,</HI> Lat. to call for help, <HI>adventrous,</HI> bold, daring, from Fr. <HI>adventureux,</HI> couragious.</P>
<P>V. 14. <HI>To soar,</HI> to get up, to take a high flight, from <HI>sorare,</HI> It. to fly high.</P>
<P>V. 15. <HI>Th' Aonian Mount,</HI> is in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> (a Province of <HI>Greece)</HI> made famous by the Poets for a Meeting of the Muses. The Country was first named <HI>Aonia</HI> from <HI>Aon,</HI> Son of <HI>Nep∣tune</HI> and the Muses, thence styled <HI>Aonides. Primus ego in Patriam mecum, (modò vita su∣persit) Aonio rediens deducam vertice Musas.</HI> Geor. Li. 3.</P>
<P>V. 16. <HI>Things unattempted yet,</HI> so <HI>Hora. Non usitata nec tenui ferar penna;</HI> but not on so sublime a Subject as this, not undertaken as yet by any Poet: As in the beginning of the Ninth Book, he says of himself, he was not sedulous by Nature to indite Wars, hitherto the only Argument, Heroic deem'd,<HI>—trita vatibus orbita.</HI> So <HI>Virg.</HI> on a Subject much inferiour makes his Brags,
<Q><L><HI>Sed me Parnassi deserta per ardua, dulcis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Raptat amor: Juvat ire jugis, qua nulla priorum</HI></L>
<L><HI>Castaliam molli divertitur orbita clivo.</HI> Geor. 3.</L></Q></P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>In Prose or Rhime,</HI> either in Prose or Poetry, <HI>Prosa,</HI> Lat. for that free and easie way of writing and speaking, unshackled and unconfined in its Parts and Periods, used by Orators, Historians, and all Men in common Conversation, styled <HI>Soluta Oratio,</HI> as op∣posite to Rhime, derived of the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, consisting of a more exact Measure and Quantity of Syllables, of which <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in Probl. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>autem longitudines, &amp; al∣titudines vocis emetitur, longior mensura vocis</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>dicitur, altior</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Aul. Gell. l. 15. c. 18. <HI>Scribimus inclusi, numeros ille, hic pede liber,</HI> Pers. Sat. 1.</P>
<P>Poetry (of which Rhime is a Modern part) is tied up to certain Measures and Quan∣tities, which, among the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, (till the times of Monkish Ignorance) con∣sisted in an Harmonious Modulation of Numbers, that implyed nothing less than the in∣convenient gingle and chime at the ends of Verses, which we falsly call Rhime; so de∣servedly disdained by our Author, for the shackles it puts upon Sense; no Comparison better suiting such Poetasters than that of Tagging of Points in a Garret.</P>
<P>V. 17. <HI>O Spirit.</HI> Divers are the Opinions concerning the meaning of <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 2. <HI>The Spirit of God moved upon the Waters. Jerom, Basil, Theodoret, Athanasius,</HI> and many of the Fathers, understand it of the third Person of the Trinity: From hence the Heathen Phi∣losophers coined their quickning and intellectual Spirit, that diffused it self through the Universe, as <HI>Zoroaster</HI> and <HI>Heraclitus,</HI> which <HI>Orpheus</HI> calls <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a fiery Breath: Hence the <HI>Platonists</HI> borrowed their <HI>Animam Mund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> and the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> learnt this great Truth, <HI>That God was all in all, in all Things and all Places;</HI> admirably exprest by the sublime <HI>Virgil;</HI>
<Q><L><HI>—Deum namque ire per omnes</HI></L>
<L><HI>Terrasque tractusque Maris, Coelumque profundum.</HI> Geor. 4.</L>
<L><HI>Principio Coelum, &amp; Terras. Camposque liquentes,</HI></L>

<P>Ibid. <HI>Fore-knowledge, Will and Fate;</HI> The Praescience and Fore-knowledge of God Almighty is indubitable, since he who is Omniscient must needs know and see all Things at one view, those that are past or yet to come, being only such in reference to finite Beings, but have no relation to him that is Eternal. From this Fore-knowledge, which in God is Absolute, as the next Verse affirms, the weak Apologists for Sin and Folly endeavour to draw a Consequen∣tial Impunity, as if whatever God foreknows will be, were by that his Fore-knowledge in∣fluenced and compelled so to come to pass, robbing at once the just Judge of all the Earth (of whom the Psalmist says, <HI>The Lord is righteous in all his Ways, and holy in all his Works, Psal.</HI> 145. <HI>v.</HI> 7.) of his Glory, and Man of his Free-will, whom <HI>God created after his Image,</HI> Gen. 1. 27. <HI>and left him in the hands of his own Counsel, Eccles.</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 14. But to avoid deriving our Finite Consequences from Incomprehensible Infinitude, many things are by Men foreknown, on which nevertheless their Foreknowledge has not the least effect or shadow of Impulse, as the Rising and Setting of the Sun, the Succession of the Seasons of the Year, the various Appearances of the Moon, and the Eclipses of both those Luminaries to the end of the World, are easie to be foreknown, yet no Man will affirm, that his Foreknowledge is the cause of any of'em.</P>

Others differ about his Torments, telling us, he had a great Stone always hanging over, and ready to fall on his Head. <HI>Homer</HI> describes his Suffer∣ings without mention of his Offence.

<HEAD>NOTES On <HI>MILTON</HI>'s PARADISE Lost.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BOOK III.</HEAD>
<P>Verse 1. <HI>HAil Holy Light,</HI> &amp;c. Hail Divine Light, Illustrious First-born, of the Almighty Word; Oh thou bright Beam of everlasting Purity, thy self as everlasting: <HI>Hail,</HI> the old word used in Salutations, answering to the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Greeks, and the Roman <HI>Salve,</HI> of the Sax. <HI>Hael,</HI> Health. By this <HI>Hail,</HI> the former of 'em, is interpreted, in the Salutation of the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> to the Mother of our Blessed Saviour, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Luc.</HI> 1. <HI>v.</HI> 28. men∣tioned by our Author in his Fifth Book.
<Q><L><HI>—On whom the Angel Hail</HI></L>
<L><HI>Bestow'd, the Holy Salutation used</HI></L>
<L><HI>Long after to Blest</HI> Mary, <HI>second</HI> Eve.</L></Q></P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>First-born;</HI> Light was doubtless the first and brightest Birth of Heaven, without which even the Deity himself is inconceivable; <HI>Speak not of GOD without Light,</HI> was <HI>Plato</HI>'s saying, and what is there among all his Creatures so expressive of his Goodness, Omniscience, and Purity? <HI>Who covereth himself with Light, as with a Garment,</HI> Psal. 104. v. 3. Light, as to the Creation of this lower World, was the first of all the Creatures that had the Almighty <HI>Fiat</HI> pronounced at its Production; <HI>Then God said, Let there be Light: and there was Light.</HI> Gen. 1. 3. So our Poet, <HI>Forthwith Light Etherial, first of all Things, sprung from the Deep.</HI></P>
<P>V. 2. <HI>Coeternal;</HI> Thou bright Beam, as everlasting as thy everlasting Father GOD Almighty: <HI>Coaeternus,</HI> Lat. of the same duration with Eternity.</P>
<P>V. 3. <HI>May I express thee unblam'd,</HI> &amp;c. Blameless may I declare thee, because God himself is Light, and from Eternity in amazing brightness, disdaining all approach of Human Eyes, dwelt from Eternity, dwelt then in the, bright Emanation of the brightest Being, Eternal, Un∣create.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>GOD is Light;</HI> Nothing can give us a clearer Idea of the Divine Incomprehensible Being, than Light: See him described; <HI>His Brightness was as the Light,</HI> Hab. 3. v. 4. <HI>God is Light, and in him is no Darkness,</HI> 1 John 1. v. 5. <HI>Every perfect Gift cometh from the Father of Lights,</HI> Jam. 1. v. 17.</P>
<P>V. 4. <HI>In unapproached Light; Who dwelleth in the Light that none can approach unto, whom no Man hath seen, nor can see,</HI> 1 Tim. 6. v. 16. When our Saviour appeared to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the transcendent Brightness blinded him; <HI>A Light from Heaven passing the brightness of the Sun,</HI> Acts 26. v. 3.</P>
<P>V. 6. <HI>Bright Effluence,</HI> &amp;c. Bright overflowing of the bright Uncreated Being: <HI>Effluentia,</HI> Lat. the Issue, Offspring, Efflux: Of <HI>Essence increate, Essentia increata,</HI> Lat. GOD Almighty, the Creator of all Things, Himself uncreated, and Self existent.</P>
<P>V. 7. <HI>Or hearst thou rather,</HI> &amp;c. Or hadst thou rather be styl'd, Pure Heavenly Stream, whose Fountain Head, who can declare? According to that of <HI>Job, Where is the way where Light dwelleth? And where is the place of Darkness? That thou shouldest receive it in the Bounds thereof, and that thou shouldest know the Paths to the House thereof,</HI> ch. 38. v. 19, and 20.</P>
<P>V. 9. <HI>Before the Sun, before the Heavens,</HI> &amp;c. Before the shining Sun, or rouling Heavens thou wert, and at the Voice of God, as with a Garment, didst array, the World arising from the Womb of Waters, gained from the empty and unfinished Deep: A noble <HI>Idea</HI> of Light,
<PB N="97" REF="50"/>
the usefullest Ornament of the Creation, without which it had been but a sad Night-piece. Many of the Fathers, both Greek and Latin, were of opinion, that the Primitive Light created on the first Day, was the Light of the Sun imperfect and unfinished, which as it contradicts the Narrative of <HI>Moses,</HI> who tells us, That the Sun and the Moon (the two great Lights) were made on the fourth Day, so it derogates from the Majesty of the Great Maker of the Uni∣verse, that any thing, on which his Omnipotent <HI>Fiat</HI> was pronounced, should come forth unfinished.</P>
<P>That this first Light was not the Sun, but a shining bright Body, like a radiant Cloud mo∣ving about the Earth, and distinguishing Day from Night, before the forming of the Sun and other Planets, is the Opinion of <HI>Bede</HI> in his <HI>Exem. Bonaventure, Nicol. de Lyra,</HI> and <HI>Tostatus,</HI> with many of the School-Divines; and of this Opinion was our Author, as at large he expresseth it, where he handles the Creation in his Seventh Book:
<Q><L><HI>—Light from her Native East</HI></L>
<L><HI>To journey through the Airy Gloom began</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spheared in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun</HI></L>
<L><HI>Was not.—</HI>According to <HI>Moses Cosmopoiaea.</HI> Gen. 1. v. 3, and 14.</L></Q></P>
<P>V. 10. <HI>As with a Mantle didst invest;</HI> As with a Glorious Mantle didst cover the dark World coming out of the deep Womb of Waters. Our Poet useth the Word <HI>Invest,</HI> B. 1. V. 208. <HI>While Night invests the Sea;</HI> there Night throws her dark Coverture o're the Waters, here Light with her glorious Garb arrays the Infant World just at its Birth, arising from the dark Deep; and the same Word does well express the Metaphor in both places. <HI>Mantle,</HI> of <HI>Manteau,</HI> Fr. of <HI>Mantelum,</HI> Lat. a Cloak.</P>
<P>V. 11, and 12. <HI>The rising World,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Won from the Void,</HI> &amp;c. A nobler Description of <HI>Chaos,</HI> than any made before, and not inferiour to that of the Sublime and Poetical. <HI>Job</HI> 12. <HI>v.</HI> 22. <HI>He discovereth the deep Places from their Darkness, and bringeth forth the shadow of Death to Light.</HI></P>
<P>V. 13. <HI>Thee I revisit now;</HI> Thee, O holy, heavenly Light, I visit now again more joyful, since I escaped from the black <HI>Stygian</HI> Lake: <HI>Revisitare,</HI> Lat.</P>
<P>V. 15. <HI>Though long detain'd in that obscure Sejourn;</HI> Though long Imprison'd in Hell's dark Dungeon: Detain'd, <HI>Detentus,</HI> Lat. kept, with-held: <HI>Sejourn,</HI> stay, of the Fr. <HI>Sejourner,</HI> to stay it, to remain in a place.</P>
<P>V. 17. <HI>With other Notes than to the Orphean Lyre;</HI> While pursuing my strange Subject through Hell the utter, and through the void empty Gulf, the middle Darkness, I sung of <HI>Chaos</HI> and everlasting Night, in Strains more lofty and sublime, than <HI>Orpheus</HI> ever Tuned his famous Harp to. <HI>Orpheus</HI> is reckoned the Son of <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Muse <HI>Calliope,</HI> an excellent Poet and Philosopher, as those famous ones of Antiquity were.

<P>V. 25. <HI>So thick a Drop serene hath quench'd their Orbs;</HI> The French express incurable Blind∣ness by <HI>Goutte serene,</HI> and explain it by a thick and continual dropping from the Head, by which the Optick Nerve is stopt and choak'd, that all Sight is thereby hindred, and irrecove∣rably lost: <HI>Serene,</HI> of the Fr. <HI>Serain,</HI> and the Ital. <HI>Sereno,</HI> (not of the Lat. <HI>Serenus,</HI> fair, clear,) signifying the Mildew, or hurtful Dew that falls in the Evenings sometimes, to which our Au∣thor compares the noxious Distillation that from his Head fell down into the Optick Nerve, and choak'd its perspicuous Passage, of the Lat. <HI>Serum.</HI></P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Quench'd their Orbs;</HI> Light and Fire are by Nature so near of Kin, that the Meta∣phor of Quenching the Eye-sight is easie and proper enough; most Person's Eyes have a shine∣ing, and many a sparkling, darting Light, especially in Youth, that issueth from them: So <HI>Virgil</HI> calls, <HI>Turnus his, Ardentes Ocalorum acies,</HI> AEn. 12. Inflam'd with Anger: Orbs, <HI>Orbes,</HI> Lat. the shining Circles of the Eyes.</P>
<P>V. 26. <HI>Or dim Suffusion veil'd;</HI> Or a dark Veil o'respread, or a black Film like a Veil has o'regrown the shining Circles of mine Eyes, and clouded 'em with everlasting Night: <HI>Suffu∣sion,</HI> of <HI>Suffusio,</HI> Lat. an overspreading, a covering, of <HI>Suffundere,</HI> Lat. to cover over.

<P>Here our Poet has hinted at the other Cause of Blindness, by Film or black Cataracts growing within the Eyes, the White being often remediable by Couching.</P>
<P>V. 27. <HI>Cease I to wander;</HI> Yet do not I forbear to follow the Muses wheresoe're they meet, at Chrystal Springs, cool Groves, or lofty Hills; the <HI>Castalian</HI> Spring at the foot of the Hill <HI>Parnassas,</HI> was a famous haunt of the Muses, so was Mount <HI>Helicon; Pieris</HI> was a Grove, in which <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Memnosyne</HI> begat the Muses: Such Groves and Hills as these are often men∣tioned by the Poets, and the Muses named of them.

The next Verse, <HI>Of Natures Works to me-expung'd and ras'd,</HI> confirms, that it ought to be an <HI>Universal Blot;</HI> for <HI>Expung'd,</HI> is of <HI>Expungere,</HI> Lat. to blot out a written Word, by covering it with little Pricks or Blots, and <HI>Ras'd,</HI> is of <HI>Radere,</HI> Lat. to shave; the Romans, (who writ on Waxed Tablets with Iron Styles) when they struck out a Word, did <HI>Tabulam radere,</HI> rase it out.</P>

<P>V. 107.<HI>—What Praise, what Pleasure I?</HI> What Praise, what Satisfaction, could Men expect from their best Deeds, or more sincere Endeavours; or what Pleasure or Delight could God himself take in the most ardent Devotions, Praises or Prayers of his Saints. when their Wills and Reason (Reason that determines the choice of Good from Evil) robb'd of all their Judi∣cious Powers and Elective Faculties, were made useless, as if bestowed in vain, or given only to be subservient to invincible Necessity, not to their Maker GOD Almighty. <HI>Despoil'd, De∣spoliatus,</HI> Lat. robbed, of <HI>Despoliare,</HI> Lat. to bereave.</P>

Read St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Ephesians, ch.</HI> 1. <HI>v.</HI> 4, 5, and 6. God (he says) had chosen us (the <HI>Ephosians)</HI> in Jesus Christ before the Foundation of the World, <HI>That we should be holy and without blame before him in Love;</HI> there is the Condition: Certainly all the <HI>Ephesians</HI> were not blameless, nor all there∣fore Elect; <HI>Having Predestinated us,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>according to the good pleasure of his will, to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace.</HI> But what Praise if the <HI>Ephesians</HI> were Elected, without a firm Belief in the Saviour of the World, and a Life conformable to his holy Example, thereby Glorifying the Riches of his Grace and Forgiveness.</P>

<P>V. 118. <HI>Fore-knowledge had no influence;</HI> The Fore-knowledge of God does not determine the Minds of Men to good or bad Actions, thô that Fore-knowledge be infinite and infallible; nor does the commission of Good or Evil depend thereon: <HI>But he that knoweth whereof we are made, and that searcheth the Hearts, and trieth the Reins, that knows all our Thoughts afar off,</HI> clearly foresees all our Faults and Failings, which we should have committed undoubtedly, al∣thô they had not been foreknown or foreseen by that infinite Eye.

Good and Evil, Life and Death, therefore are in the Choice, and ballance the Wills of all Mankind; they have the Election of their Mis∣chiefs and Miscarriages in their own Power; neither does any Influence of the Stars, or pre∣tended Power of Fate, bend or incline their Wills to Folly, were there any Power so co∣ercive, as to constrain and force them unto Wickedness, Mankind, nay even the worst of them, would not be inexcusable; they <HI>Decree therefore their own Revolt,</HI> that Defection from their Maker to his and their Enemy the Devil. It is observable, that where God cautions the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI> against the false Prophets that should go about to turn them away after other Gods, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used, a word properly signifying a <HI>Revolt, Deut.</HI> 13. <HI>v.</HI> 5. as also <HI>Jer.</HI> 28. <HI>v.</HI> 16. and <HI>ch.</HI> 29. <HI>v.</HI> 32. in both which it is translated <HI>Rebellion.</HI></P>

To what end are all the Promises of Happiness, and the Rewards of everlasting Life, and the Terrors of the Lord, his Threatnings, and the repeated Denuntiations of Eter∣nal Punishment, Damnation, and Hell, to obstinate and impenitent Sinners? If they that do well, and those that commit Iniquity, do both not what they would, but what they are con∣strained to do, obey not God, but Necessity; how <HI>shall the Judge of all the Earth do Judgment,</HI> as <HI>Abraham</HI> says in his humble Expostulation with his Maker? <HI>Gen.</HI> 18. <HI>v.</HI> 25. <HI>Is God un∣righteous who taketh Vengeance?

V. 334. <HI>The World shall burn; The Heaven and the Earth which are now, by the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto Fire against the Day of Judgment, and perdition of ungodly Men.

<P>How this lower World, and all therein, may probably enough be liable to a General Con∣flagration, is easie to imagine; but how the Heavens, the Celestial Bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, those bright burning Beings, which many of the Fathers, as well as Philosophers, believed to consist and be made of Fire, shall be obnoxious to it, is not so familiar to our Understand∣ings. Certain it is, the World shall have an end, Generation and Corruption shall cease, Mo∣tion give place to Rest, and Time to Eternity; and then both the Elementary and Celestial Bodies having performed and finified their Function, and all their Vicissitudes and manifold Mutations being determined, shall be done away. <HI>The Heavens, the work of thy hands, they shall perish, but thou shalt endure, yea all of them shall wax old like a Garment: as a Vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed,</HI> Psal. 102. 26.

V. 342. <HI>Who, to compass all this, dies;</HI> Who yields himself up to Death, to bring all this to pass: <HI>O faelix-culpa, quae talem ac tantum meruerit habere Redemptorem.</HI> Greg. Our Author has been entertaining us for 264 Lines, with a Discourse of the highest Nature, as the Mysteries of God's Mercy and Justice to Mankind; of Free-will, of the inconceivable Incarnation of his Son, and all the nicest Points of Faith: And has acquitted himself of this great Undertaking as well as is possible for Human Understanding to do, in things so much exceeding the com∣pass of our Capacities. He has kept close to the Revelations of Holy Writ, as appears by the Quotations vouching each Verse, <HI>Homer,</HI> instead of Treating the Deities of his Days, with any tolerable Decency, makes them Quarrelsome, Vulnerable, and of a Behaviour below that of a Stoic Philosopher, as is frequent through all his <HI>Iliads:</HI> His <HI>Venus</HI> stands with a Fly-flap in her hand, to keep the corrupting Insects from infecting the Corps of her Son's dead Favou∣rite, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

This happy Seat, and State, free from all Disturbance, had not its Foundation only from Fancy, but was bor∣rowed from the Sacred Writings, and was Copied from <HI>Moses</HI>'s Paradise; and accordingly the Rabbins tell us, that <HI>Elysium</HI> sounds in the Holy Language, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>The Grove of God.</HI> The floridness of these <HI>Elysium Groves,</HI> is expressed thus by <HI>Tibullus:</HI>

<P>V. 495. <HI>Into a Limbo large and broad; Limbus,</HI> Lat. for the Welt or Hem of a Garment, by the School men supposed the place in the Neighbourhood of Hell, where the Souls of the Just, who dyed before the Ascension of our Saviour, were detained, and into which they consign the Souls of the Infants dying unbaptized. A daring and enterprizing Opinion, grounded on these following Texts of Scripture: <HI>Jacob</HI> mourning for the suppofed Death of his Son <HI>Joseph,</HI> says in the bitterness of his Soul; <HI>I will go down into the Grave unto my Son mourning,</HI> Gen. 35. 35.

<P>But the Sacred Quotations, on which these Prying Architects do most insist, are <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 22. where the Angels carried <HI>Lazarus into Abraham's bosom;</HI> which has made 'em add to their <HI>Limbus Patrum,</HI> that of <HI>Sinus Abrahae;</HI> which is so far from being a description of the Place in this Parable of our Saviour, that it leaves us in the same mysterious Incertainty; and whereas the Romanists infer from <HI>v.</HI> 26. <HI>Between us and you there is a great Gulf fixed,</HI> that this <HI>Limbus</HI> is not ill situated, and so near the place of Torment as their Adversaries affirm, the whole pro∣ceeding

<HEAD>BOOK IV.</HEAD>
<P>V. 2. <HI>WHO saw th'Apocalyps;</HI> Who in a Vision saw the Revelation of what was to befal the Church of God to the end of the World. St. <HI>John</HI> (who though in the Front of the <HI>Revelation</HI> he be named <HI>the Divine)</HI> is yet held to be the same who writ the Gospel called by his Name, as <HI>Ire∣naeus, Hieronymus, Eusebius</HI> and others affirm; the difference of the style being no more, than that in the one, he has used that of a Prophet; and in the other, that of an Historian. <HI>Apocalyps,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a Discovery, a Revealing of hidden Mysteries, thence translated <HI>the Revelations,</HI> of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to discover, tho' still extreamly obscure, like those Acroatick parts of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Philosophy, which he says were <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This obscure Discovery was written by St. <HI>John,</HI> in the Island <HI>Patmos,</HI> whither he was banish'd by <HI>Domitian</HI> about the 14th Year of his Reign, 64 Years after the Death of our Saviour, and four Years before his own, as the Chronologers relate.</P>
<P>V. 3. <HI>When the Dragon put to second rout;</HI> Interpreters of <HI>Revel.</HI> 12. whence this is taken, are of Opinion, that as <HI>Satan</HI> was, after his Rebellion, thrown out of Heaven in the beginning of time, so towards the end of it and the World, he shall be beaten out of his lower Dominion usurpt by him, and be no longer Prince of the Air, here called his <HI>second rout.</HI> The Dragon, Satan.</P>
<P>V. 14. <HI>Far off, and fearless;</HI> Fearless, yet keeping distance; though undaunted, yet wary in approaching.</P>
<P>V. 17. <HI>A Devilish Engine back recoils;</HI> Like a great Gun, that at discharging its destructive Entrails, runs back with mighty force and rude repulse; so this malicious attempt of Satan on frail Man, beats back again upon himself in hideous Horrours and distracting Doubt, of what he was, is, and must be to all Eternity. <HI>Recoils,</HI> of <HI>Reculer,</HI> Fr. to give back, to run back as a Cannon when fired.</P>
<P>V. 18. <HI>Horrour and Doubt distract,</HI> &amp;c. The amazement of his Guilt, and the uncertain suc∣cess of new Mischiefs undertaken, which how much they may add more to his Punishment than Revenge, confounds all Consideration. <HI>Distracts his Thoughts;</HI> Put him upon a Rack, where all his Resolutions against th'Almighty, vain and frivolous, are rent to pieces. <HI>Distracts,</HI> of <HI>distrahere,</HI> Lat. to pull in pieces.</P>
<P>V. 20. <HI>For within him Hell he brings;</HI> Is his own Hell and Tormentor. Change of Place gives no allay or intermission to his Pains: He travels with Hell about him and within him. <HI>Coelum non Animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.</HI></P>

<P>V. 40. <HI>Till Pride and worse Ambition;</HI> Pride is a kind of excessive and vicious Self-esteem, that raises Men in their own Opinions above what is just and right: But Ambition is that which adds Fewel to this Flame, and claps Spurs to these furious and inordinate Desires that break forth into the most execrable Acts to accomplish their haughty Designs; which makes our Author stigmatize Ambition as a worse Sin than Pride.</P>
<P>V. 45. <HI>With his Good upbraided none;</HI> Did not with his Bountiful Goodness twit or reproach his Creatures. <HI>Upbraid,</HI> of <HI>Upgebredan,</HI> Sax. to scorn, or reproach one with any thing received.</P>

<P>V. 114. <HI>Each Passion dimm'd his Face;</HI> While he made this Speech, full of sad and dismal Reflections, disquieted with Anger, Envy and Despair, each of these Passions darkened and over∣cast his Countenance, which spoiled his disguise, and discovered him a Cheat and Impostor. <HI>Coun∣terfeit,</HI> false, of the Fr. <HI>Countrefaict,</HI> false Money stampt in Imitation of the true.</P>

<P>V. 308. <HI>Which imply'd Subjection:</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, That <HI>even Nature it self teacheth, that for Men to wear long Hair is a shame;</HI> that is, a disgrace, and sign of a soft and effeminate temper: <HI>But if a Woman have long Hair, it is a Glory to her; for her Hair is given her for a Vail,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.

seem to have learn'd the Custom of Vailing Women, especially at their Marriages, from this dictate of Nature, and the word <HI>nubere</HI> always applyed to Women, was taken <HI>à nubendo,</HI> from Vailing them, when Married and put into their Husbands Power; whence the witty <HI>Martial</HI> says, <HI>Uxori nubere nolo meae.</HI> Now this Natural Vail of Womankind, is by the Apostle in the Chapter above-cited, used as an Argument and Indication of their <HI>Subjection,</HI> but as our Poet sweetens it, to be <HI>required with gentle sway,</HI> on soft and easie terms, to be grounded on Reason, on just and fit, and supported and maintained by all imaginable Tenderness, and soft Endear∣ments.</P>

<P><HI>Modest Pride,</HI> seems to imply, that just Value and modest Self-esteem, that the Fair Sex ought to regard; that <HI>Conscience of their Worth,</HI> which if well managed, sets off the soft Sub∣mission of a kind Companion, and differences it from the dull forc'd Obedience of a Slave. This pretty mixture of Modesty and Pride, is the Safeguard of the Sex, not too stiff and in∣compliant, yet inflexible, and disdaining to descend to any Indecency or Indiscretion; a little Pride being a necessary Ingredient to preserve both Body and Mind in their Native Cleanliness and Purity.</P>

<P>V. 312. <HI>Nor those Mysterious Parts,</HI> &amp;c. Those Privy Parts then were not hid. All the Se∣crets of Heathen Religion and Philosophy were carefully concealed from the Vulgar, and therefore called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Mysteries, not exposed to common and profane Eyes, but by con∣stant Concealment made more Awful and Majestick.

<P>V. 313. <HI>Guilty—Dishonest Shame;</HI> Unseemly Shame, the Off-spring of Guilt and Sin: <HI>Dif∣honest,</HI> ugly, disgraceful, of <HI>dis,</HI> the Privative Particle, and <HI>honestus,</HI> Lat. comely. <HI>Shame,</HI> of the Gr. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, because discoverable in the Face, disordered by the guilty Blush.</P>
<P>V. 314. <HI>Honour dishonourable; Nihil Naturale turpe,</HI> is an Axiom most true, That none of the Works and Acts of Nature are disgraceful; yet Sinful Mankind have introduced among them <HI>Dishonest Shame,</HI> and <HI>a Dishonourable sort of Honour,</HI> the meer Shews and Pretences of <HI>Pu∣rity,</HI> which in their first state of <HI>Simplicity and Innocence,</HI> were Strangers to the World, when Man, absolute Master of himself, of all his Thoughts and Passions, that obey'd the Sovereignty of Reason, dreaded no Indecency, though naked, because innocent; still visible in Children, that play naked without the Crimson Coverture of a Blush, till they attain the sense of <HI>Guilty Shame.</HI></P>
<P>V. 323. Adam <HI>the goodliest Man of Men,</HI> &amp;c. That the Protoplast, the first Man, came most com∣pleat out of the Hand of his Creator, perfect in all the Powers and Faculties both of Body and Soul: That his Consort and Derivative <HI>Eve</HI> was also accomplish'd in like manner, in the full Bloom of Beauty, and all the Charming Ornaments of which her Sex was capable, is beyond all question: That they were of Growth fit for Propagation, and of Understanding capable of GOD's Commands, is evident from the Benediction bestowed on 'em, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. Vers. 28. and the Injunction <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. Vers. 17. which gave rise to that Opinion of the Fathers, that <HI>Adam</HI> was created of the Size that his Sons might arrive at about Fifty Years old, (Childhood and Youth inlarging and lessening in the times of different Longaevity;) and therefore doubtless they did not only excel all their Descendents, as the first Originals of Mankind, but as the most ex∣act Image of their Maker, while they continued in glorious Innocence, which in their sinful Posterity is so defaced, that the most accomplish'd of either Sex, is but a dull dry Copy of those Master-Pieces of the Almighty.</P>

'Tis the general Opinion, and highly probable, that before <HI>Adam</HI> violated the Command of his Maker, there was an Universal Peace, even among the fiercest Beasts, throughout the whole Creation; but Sin being the Pa∣rent of Death, disturbed that happy Concord and Harmony of Nature, and in order to De∣struction, introduced Violence and Slaughter first among the Brutes and Irrational Beings, and early too among the Sons of <HI>Adam.

<P>V. 360. <HI>Earth-born perhaps; And the Lord God formed Man of the Dust of the Ground,</HI> Gen. 2. 7.

V. 746. <HI>Defaming as impure;</HI> Reproaching as impure and unseemly.

<P>V. 341. <HI>For Signs,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 14. Divers are the Interpretations of these Words; some understand 'em, of the Solemn Feasts and New Moons celebrated under the <HI>Mosaic Law.</HI> Others, for Signs of the changes of the Weather, Winds, Plenty, Health, and their Contraries.

The vain Asserters of <HI>Ju∣dicial Astrology</HI> would have 'em meant, of the Signs placed in the Heavens, whereon to ground their Presumptuous Predictions. The best and genuine is, That God appointed them for Signs of the Seasons, of Time, of Days, and Years; for the motion of the Stars, and chiefly of the Sun and Moon, is the measure of Time: A Day is the time of the Sun's circuit about the Earth; an Hour, the 24th part of it; a Year, his compleat Journey through the <HI>Zodiac;</HI> a Month, his motion through one Sign of it, while the Moon travels quite through it. Now Celestial Motion, and that chiefly of the Sun, being the most regular, unalterable, and commu∣nicable to all Mankind, is the best and most common Calculation of Times and Seasons, and of <HI>circling Years, compleating their radiant Rounds.</HI></P>

Some Fish live much longer out of their Element than others; and <HI>Gesner</HI> from <HI>Albertus</HI> tells us, That Eels in a long Frost have been found bedded in a Haycock adjoyning to a River lusty and lively, and that an Eel has in warm Weather lived 5 days out of the Water.

<P>V. 661. <HI>Of this fair Tree amidst the Garden;</HI> It is evident that the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> as well as that of the <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> grew in the <HI>midst of the Garden,</HI> Gen. 2. 9. Now God having interdicted only the last of these, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 16, 17. <HI>Eve</HI> seems to prevaricate, by answer∣ing the Serpent, <HI>Of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,</HI> Gen. 3. 3. equally ap∣plicable to the Tree of Life, as to that forbidden one. <HI>Ergo jam impatienter ferebat &amp; murmu∣rabat mulier, quod quasi parcus vel avarus Deus, praetiosa medii Paradisi reservaret, &amp; viliora quaeque per circuitum colligenda, in cibum homini concessisset.</HI> Rupert.</P>
<P>V. 663. <HI>Nor touch it lest you die,</HI> Gen. 3. 3. Which words, because not recorded where the Command is first mentioncd, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 16. are supposed by some <HI>Interpreters</HI> to have been the <HI>Injunction</HI> and <HI>Addition</HI> of <HI>Adam,</HI> to deterr his Wife even from touching the <HI>Interdicted Tree;</HI> by others, as an Aggravation of God's Severity, added by <HI>Eve</HI> her self in this dangerous Dia∣logue, to whom God's Command began already to gtow grievous, and therefore by her mis∣reported. <HI>Lest you die,</HI> seems also a diminution, and slighting of positive threatning them with most certain Death: <HI>Haec verba mulieris, jam vitiatae mentis indicia sunt. Diminuit, quia cum certâ &amp; affirmativâ enunciatione dixerit Deus, in quocunque die comederis ex eo, morte morieris, haec dubium vel frivolum volens esse illud, ne fortè inquit moriamur.</HI> Rupert.</P>

<P>V. 688. <HI>Me who have touch'd and tasted;</HI> Our Poet has so finely handled the Serpent's Temp∣tation, as to answer all the Allegations made of <HI>Eve</HI>'s wonderful Simplicity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He introdu∣ceth the <HI>Devil,</HI> reasoning in the <HI>Serpent,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so strange a degree, pretending, by his eating of the forbidden Tree, to have obtain'd both Speech and Reason, exalted and ennobled thereby above all other Creatures, that the Objections <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erius</HI> puts into her mouth, would have been of no defence to her. <HI>Dixisset mulier serpenti, si ita est, ut dicis, cur tu non edis ex istà arbore, ut quod mihi promittis, ipse consequaris?

<P>V. 165. <HI>Serpent thô Brute,</HI> &amp;c. Or the Serpent void of Reason, and incapable of laying the blame on Satan, who used him as the instrument of his malicious Design on Man, thereby corrupted and defiled against the course of his Creation. Venomous Serpents, as other wild and dangerous Creatures, were all innoxious and harmless to Mankind before their Fall and Fault; but the wily Serpent, here mentioned, was by the Devil made dangerous and destru∣ctive to <HI>Eve,</HI> as the <HI>Organ</HI> of his Temptation, even before her failure, therefore well censured as Polluted and Profaned, and devious from the true intent of his Creation.

<P>V. 169. <HI>Accurs'd as vitiated in Nature;</HI> Accurs'd as corrupted in Nature, as having cor∣rupted and depraved his natural Innocency, made to obey, not to beguile Mankind; Rebel against the Universal Command given <HI>Adam</HI> over the Creation, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 28. and Traitor against Nature's great Universal Lord.

V. 193. <HI>Thy Sorrow by thy Conception;</HI> According to the best Exposition of <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 16. the Pains and Pangs of Child-bearing, are by common Experience known to be so acute, that our Saviour by them was pleased to Typifie the great Tribulations, <HI>Persecutions</HI> and <HI>Martyrdoms</HI> of his <HI>Apostles</HI> and Followers; <HI>A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow, because her hour is come,</HI> John 16. 21.

But this <HI>possibility of Never Dying,</HI> did not result from his <HI>Nature,</HI> for by that he was Mortal, and subject to Decay, as living an <HI>Ani∣mal Life;</HI> but had he kept his Innocence, God would have so preserved and protected him, that after a long Life here, he would have translated him to immutable, secure, and unforfeitable Immortality in everlasting Bliss, without passing through Corruption, and the dark Grave, as <HI>Enoch</HI> was, that he might not see Death, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 5.

Therefore <HI>Immortality</HI> imports a <HI>Longevity</HI> of undisturb'd Happiness, and undistemper'd Health, which should have transmitted Mankind into Heaven at God's ap∣pointed time. But having lost his Happiness, which depended on his Innocence, Immortality would have proved a Punishment, an everlasting Disease, whose only Remedy and Cure is Death, the Restorative of his Primitive State, and Eternal Bliss. Hence that of St. <HI>Paul, To die is great gain,</HI> Phil. 1. 21.

<P>V. 95. <HI>And live for ever;</HI> If <HI>Adam</HI> had not sinned, he had never suffered Death, <HI>which by sin entred into the world,</HI> Rom. 5. 12. yet was he even in his Innocency <HI>Mortal,</HI> that is, under a <HI>possibility of Decay and Death,</HI> from which God would have preserved him; Sin then did not make him <HI>Mortal,</HI> but with his Innocency bereaved him of God's wonderful Preservation, and delivered him up to his natural Mortality. <HI>Homo qui mortalis erat, &amp; redigi natur aliter poterat, in suum cinerem, voluntate Dei viveret semper, nisi peccatum obstitisset; non est itaque per peccatum factus mortalis, sed qui cum erat innocens voluntate Dei servabatur, ob peccatum traditus est suae mor∣talitati.</HI> Vall. c. 6.</P>
<P>How this wonderful Preservation depended on the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> is hard to guess; most probable it is, that the Fruit of this Restorative Tree was most connatural to Man's Life, ea∣siest to be turned into, and assimulated into his Substance, endowed with a Preservative Power against all Decay, by which our Lives had been lengthen'd out to a vast Longevity, till it had pleased our Creator to have removed and transplanted us into Heaven. For, <HI>For ever,</HI> does not imply <HI>Eternity,</HI> but a long <HI>Duration of Time,</HI> in <HI>Scripture;</HI> as of the Servant, whose Ear was bored through, <HI>He shall be thy servant for ever,</HI> Deut. 15. 17.

<P><HI>Now lest he put forth his hand, and take also the tree of life, and eat and live for ever,</HI> Gen. 3. 22.

<P>Ibid. <HI>Dream at least to live for ever;</HI> Shews our <HI>Author</HI> did not understand the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> capable of making <HI>Adam</HI> live Eternally, without Removal into the Heavenly Regions. <HI>Ruper∣tus</HI> believed this wonderful Fruit, endued with a Power, able to have made <HI>Adam</HI> Immortal, if he had once tasted of it, and that <HI>Satan</HI> and he were both ignorant, that there was such a <HI>Pre∣servative Plant</HI> in <HI>God's Garden,</HI> for had the Devil known it, as he made him miserable by Eat∣ing of the <HI>forbidden Tree,</HI> so he would have endeavoured to have made that <HI>Misery perpetual,</HI> by perswading him to have eaten of the <HI>Tree of Life. Si enim vel ille scisset, nunquam consilium suae malignitatis ita dimidiasset: sed sicut illud lignum temerare persuasit, ut miseros faceret: sic &amp; istud praeripere suasisset, ut aeternaliter miseros &amp; misere aeternos efficeret.</HI> Com. in Gen. c. 30. l. 3.

The cause of its three most distinct Colours is thus assigned; Its <HI>deep full Red</HI> proceeds of the Sun's bright Beams reflected from the Clouds greatest <HI>opacity,</HI> or thick∣ness; The <HI>Green,</HI> of that part next to the most <HI>opace,</HI> and the <HI>light Red [Puniceus Colour],</HI> of the thinnest and easiest pierc'd part of the Cloud. <HI>Vall. de Sac.

And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature, of all flesh that is upon the earth,</HI> Gen. 9. 16. That the <HI>Rainbow</HI> was seen in the Clouds often before the Deluge, is not to be doubted, because its Natural Causes were then in being, the Sun shining on opposite Clouds: But <HI>God</HI> made choice of it for a sign of his <HI>Covenant</HI> with <HI>Noah</HI> and his Poste∣ritp, it being naturally the most fit and proper, as the Token of decreasing Rain, as never to be seen but when the Clouds are thin, and the chearful Sun shines on them; as <HI>Vallesius</HI> has well observed, <HI>c.</HI> 9. Those that suppose the <HI>Rainbow</HI> was, at God's Covenant with <HI>Noah,</HI> first set in the Clouds, are forc'd to believe, that till the 600 years of his Life, God had not caused it to rain on the Earth, but water'd it with Mists, or by overflowing of Rivers, as <HI>Egypt</HI> by the <HI>Nile,</HI> otherwise it must have been there before.
